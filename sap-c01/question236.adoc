You are designing multi-region architecture, and you want to send users to a geographic location based on latency-based routing, which seems simple enough.
However, you also want to use weighted-based routing among resources within that region.
Which of the below setups would best accomplish this?

* [*] A. You will need to use complex routing (nested recordsets) and ensure that you define the latency based records first.
* [*] B. You will need to use complex routing (nested recordsets) and ensure that you define the weighted resource record sets first.
* [ ] C. This cannot be done. You can`t use different routing records together.
* [ ] D. You will need to use AAAA - IPv6 addresses when you define your weighted based record sets.

Click on the arrows to vote for the correct answer
A.
B.
C.
D.
Answer - B.
Option A is incorrect because you need to define the recordset to be pointed to (in this case, weighted) before creating the top level recordset (in this case, latency).
Option B is CORRECT because you need to create the weighted policies first because you will use those record sets as the alias pointing to in the latency record sets.
Option C is incorrect because you can create the nested recordsets to accomplish this.
Option D is incorrect because the use of IPv6 is not mandatory in this configuration (and it does not mention any latency based routing - which is one of the requirements).
Please refer to the below documentation from AWS for an example where you can define complex routing.
Please find the below link for complex-based routing.
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-complex-configs.html
To accomplish geographic location-based routing with weighted-based routing among resources within the region in a multi-region architecture, you will need to use complex routing (nested record sets) and ensure that you define the latency-based records first.
Latency-based routing directs traffic to the region with the lowest latency, which results in faster response times and better user experience. Weighted routing directs traffic to specific resources within a region based on defined weights.
By using nested record sets, you can combine these two types of routing to achieve the desired setup. You can set up a top-level latency-based record set that directs traffic to the appropriate region based on latency. Within each region, you can set up a weighted resource record set that directs traffic to specific resources based on the defined weights.
It's important to define the latency-based record sets first because they will determine which region the traffic goes to, and then the weighted resource record sets can be defined for resources within that region.
Option A is the correct answer as it correctly explains the setup required for achieving the desired outcome. Option B is incorrect because it suggests defining the weighted resource record sets first, which would not work as expected. Option C is incorrect because different routing records can be used together with the use of nested record sets. Option D is irrelevant because AAAA-IPv6 addresses are not necessary for this setup.
