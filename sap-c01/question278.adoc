Click on the arrows to vote for the correct answer
A.
B.
C.
D.
Answer - A.
Option A is correct because only one main route table will be created.
It is associated with the private subnet.
A custom route table is associated with the public subnet.
Below is the general diagram of what is created when you have a private and public subnet used when using the VPC wizard.
2 subnets - one private and one public.
One NAT Gateway to route traffic from the public to private subnet.
One internet gateway is attached to the VPC.Options B, C and D are incorrect because the VPC Wizard creates them by default.

Sure, I'd be happy to help explain the answer to this question!
When a user creates a VPC using the VPC wizard, several components are automatically created by default. These include the VPC itself, one or more subnets (depending on the options chosen), a default security group, and a default network ACL. However, not all components are created by the VPC wizard.
Let's go through each answer choice and see which component is not created by the VPC wizard:
A. VPC will create two main route tables associated with the public subnet and private subnet.
This is true. When a user creates a VPC with public and private subnets using the VPC wizard, two main route tables are created by default - one associated with the public subnet and one associated with the private subnet.
B. VPC will create a private subnet with a size x.x.x.x/24 IPv4 CIDR block.
This is true. When a user creates a VPC with public and private subnets using the VPC wizard, a private subnet is created by default with a size of x.x.x.x/24 IPv4 CIDR block.
C. VPC will create an Internet gateway.
This is true. When a user creates a VPC with public and private subnets using the VPC wizard, an Internet Gateway (IGW) is created by default. The IGW allows resources within the VPC to communicate with the internet.
D. VPC will create a NAT Gateway in the public subnet.
This is false. When a user creates a VPC with public and private subnets using the VPC wizard, a NAT Gateway is not created by default. A NAT Gateway is used to enable instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS services, but this must be explicitly configured by the user.
Therefore, the correct answer to the question is D. A NAT Gateway is not created by the VPC wizard when a user creates a VPC with public and private subnets.
