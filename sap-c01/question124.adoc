There is a requirement to split a VPC with a CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/24 into two subnets, each of which should give 128 IP addresses (including the 5 fixed IPs reserved by AWS)
Can this be done and if so, how will the allocation of the IP addresses be configured? Choose the correct answer from the below options.

* [*] A. One subnet will use CIDR block 10.0.0.0/127 (for addresses 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.127) and the other will use CIDR block 10.0.0.128/255 (for addresses 10.0.0.128 - 10.0.0.255).
* [ ] B. One subnet will use CIDR block 10.0.0.0/25 (for addresses 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.127) and the other will use CIDR block 10.0.1.0/25 (for addresses 10.0.1.0 - 10.0.1.127).
* [*] C. One subnet will use CIDR block 10.0.0.0/25 (for addresses 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.127) and the other will use CIDR block 10.0.0.128/25 (for addresses 10.0.0.128 - 10.0.0.255).

Answer - C.
This is clearly given in the AWS documentation.
" For example, if you create a VPC with CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24, it supports 256 IP addresses.
You can break this CIDR block into two subnets, each supporting 128 IP addresses.
One subnet uses CIDR block 10.0.0.0/25 (for addresses 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.127) and the other uses CIDR block 10.0.0.128/25 (for addresses 10.0.0.128 - 10.0.0.255)".
For more information on VPC and subnets, please see the below link-
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Subnets.html
To get the IP addresses and subnets, please see the below link-
http://www.subnet-calculator.com/cidr.php
To split a VPC with a CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/24 into two subnets, each of which should give 128 IP addresses (including the 5 fixed IPs reserved by AWS), we need to divide the /24 network into two smaller subnets of /25.
The /25 network provides 128 IP addresses, out of which 5 IP addresses are reserved by AWS for various purposes such as network address, broadcast address, etc. This means that each of the two subnets would have 123 usable IP addresses.
Option A suggests that we use CIDR block 10.0.0.0/127 (for addresses 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.127) and the other will use CIDR block 10.0.0.128/255 (for addresses 10.0.0.128 - 10.0.0.255). This option is incorrect because the subnet mask /127 only allows for two IP addresses, which is not sufficient to provide 123 usable IP addresses required by each subnet.
Option B suggests that we use CIDR block 10.0.0.0/25 (for addresses 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.127) and the other will use CIDR block 10.0.1.0/25 (for addresses 10.0.1.0 - 10.0.1.127). This option is incorrect because the two subnets are not contiguous, and it is not possible to have a contiguous CIDR block that spans two non-contiguous /25 subnets.
Option C suggests that we use CIDR block 10.0.0.0/25 (for addresses 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.127) and the other will use CIDR block 10.0.0.128/25 (for addresses 10.0.0.128 - 10.0.0.255). This option is correct because it provides two contiguous subnets of /25 each, with 123 usable IP addresses in each subnet.
Therefore, the correct answer is option C.
