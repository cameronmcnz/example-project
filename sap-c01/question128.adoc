A middle-sized company is planning to migrate its on-premises servers to AWS.
At the moment, they have used various licenses, including windows operating system server, SQL Server, IBM Db2, SAP ERP, etc.
After migration, the existing licenses should continue to work in EC2
The IT administrators prefer to use a centralized place to control and manage the licenses to prevent potential non-compliant license usages.
For example, SQL Server Standard's license only allows 50 vCPUs, which means a rule is needed to limit the number of SQL Servers in EC2
Which option is correct for the IT administrators to use?

* [*] A. Create license rules in AWS System Manager for all BYOL licenses. Use the rules to make sure that there are no non-compliant activities. Link the rules when EC2 AMI is created. System Manager console has provided license usage status.
* [*] B. Define license rules in AWS License Manager for the required licenses. Enforce the license rules in EC2 and track usage in the AWS License Manager console.
* [*] C. Use a license management blueprint to create a dedicated Lambda to control license usage. Lambda outputs the usage status to Cloudwatch Metrics which can be used by the administrators to track the status.
* [ ] D. Define and enforce license rules in AWS License Manager for the Microsoft relevant licenses such as windows, SQL Server as only Microsoft licenses are supported. For the other licenses such as IBM Db2, track the license usage in AWS System Manager.

Correct Answer - B.
AWS License Manager is a central place to manage licenses in AWS EC2 and on-premises instances.
It contains 3 parts to use:
Define licensing rules.
Enforce licensing rules.
Track usage.
AWS License Manager currently integrates with Amazon EC2, allowing you to track licenses for default (shared-tenancy) EC2 instances, Dedicated Instances, Dedicated Hosts, Spot Instances, and Spot Fleet, and Auto Scaling groups.
Refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/license-manager/latest/userguide/license-manager.html.
Option A is incorrect.
Because AWS License Manager manages the BYOL licenses.
Although AWS System Manager can work together with AWS License Manager to manage licenses for on-premises servers and non-AWS public clouds, it is not the central place to provide license management.
Option B is CORRECT: Because AWS License Manager can define licensing rules, track license usage, and enforce controls on license use to reduce the risk of license overages.
Option C is incorrect: Because the AWS License manager should be considered first for licensing management.
Option D is incorrect: Because AWS License Manager can manage non-Microsoft licenses.
According to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/license-manager/latest/userguide/license-manager.html, license Manager tracks various software products from Microsoft, IBM, SAP, Oracle, and other vendors.
The correct option for the IT administrators to use is option B: Define license rules in AWS License Manager for the required licenses. Enforce the license rules in EC2 and track usage in the AWS License Manager console.
AWS License Manager is a service that allows IT administrators to manage their software licenses in AWS. It simplifies the management of licenses for software that runs on Amazon EC2 instances. By using AWS License Manager, IT administrators can ensure that their software is properly licensed and compliant with the license terms.
In this scenario, the IT administrators want to use a centralized place to control and manage licenses to prevent potential non-compliant license usages. They also want to ensure that the existing licenses continue to work in EC2 after migration. AWS License Manager allows them to do both.
Option A is not the correct answer because while AWS System Manager can be used to manage software licenses, it is not specifically designed for this purpose. Moreover, AWS System Manager does not provide a dedicated console to track license usage, which is important for compliance purposes.
Option C is not the correct answer because using a license management blueprint to create a dedicated Lambda function to control license usage is a complex and unnecessary solution. AWS License Manager already provides a simple and effective way to define and enforce license rules.
Option D is not the correct answer because it only defines and enforces license rules for Microsoft licenses such as Windows and SQL Server, but not for other licenses such as IBM Db2. This approach would not be sufficient for compliance purposes.
In conclusion, AWS License Manager is the best option for the IT administrators to use because it allows them to define and enforce license rules for all the required licenses, and track usage in a centralized console. This will help them ensure compliance and prevent potential non-compliant license usage.
