A company is currently utilizing a Redshift cluster as its production warehouse.
As a cloud architect, you are tasked to ensure that disaster recovery is in place.
Which would be the best option in addressing this issue?

Configure Cross-Region Snapshots

You can configure cross-regional snapshots when you want Amazon Redshift to
‘automatically copy snapshots (automated or manual) to another region for backup
purposes. Note that copying snapshots from the source region to a destination region
incurs data transfer charges.

Enable Cross-Region Snapshots @ Yes © No

Correct Answer - B.
The below diagram shows that snapshots are available for Redshift clusters enabling them to be available in different regions.

To ensure disaster recovery for a production Redshift cluster, enabling cross-region snapshots would be the best option.
Option A, taking a copy of the underlying EBS volumes to S3 and then doing cross-region replication, could be a viable option, but it is not as efficient as using cross-region snapshots. This approach requires more manual work and has a higher risk of data loss or corruption during the transfer.
Option C, creating a CloudFormation template to restore the cluster in another region, would provide a way to recover the Redshift cluster in the event of a disaster, but it would require a longer recovery time as it involves rebuilding the entire infrastructure from scratch.
Option D, enabling cross-availability zone snapshots for the Redshift cluster, is not a good option for disaster recovery because the snapshots would be stored in the same region as the cluster, and thus would not protect against a region-wide outage.
Therefore, the best option for disaster recovery is to enable cross-region snapshots for the Redshift cluster. Cross-region snapshots provide a point-in-time copy of the cluster, including all data, metadata, and configuration settings, and store them in a different region than the production cluster. This approach allows for quick and efficient recovery of the cluster in the event of a disaster, minimizing the impact on the business.
