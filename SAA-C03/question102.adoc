You have an EC2 instance in the AWS us-east-1 region.
The application in the instance needs to access a DynamoDB table that is located in the AWS us-east-2 region.
The connection must be private without leaving the Amazon network.
The instance should not use any public IP for communication.
How would you configure this?

This problem is solved by VPC peering.

VPC peering in AWS is a networking connection between two Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) that allows them to communicate with each other using private IP addresses. It enables you to establish a private network connection between VPCs in the same AWS account or different AWS accounts within the same region or across different regions.

With VPC peering, you can extend your network connectivity and share resources between VPCs without the need for a separate virtual private network (VPN) or internet gateway. It provides a secure and low-latency connection between VPCs, allowing you to transfer data and communicate between instances as if they were on the same network.

Key points to understand about VPC peering in AWS:

Private Connectivity: VPC peering allows you to establish private connectivity between VPCs, enabling communication using private IP addresses. This ensures that the traffic between VPCs stays within the AWS network and does not traverse the public internet.

Overlapping IP Addresses: VPC peering supports communication between VPCs with non-overlapping IP address ranges. If there are overlapping IP addresses between the VPCs, you cannot establish a VPC peering connection.

Transitive Peering: VPC peering does not support transitive peering. This means that if VPC A is peered with VPC B and VPC B is peered with VPC C, VPC A and VPC C cannot communicate directly through the peering connection between A and B. Separate peering connections are required for A to communicate with C.

Routing: After establishing a VPC peering connection, you need to update the route tables of both VPCs to allow traffic to flow between them. Each VPC needs a route entry that points to the other VPC's IP range via the peering connection.

Security: VPC peering operates at the network layer and does not provide any additional security features. Security groups and network ACLs should be appropriately configured to control inbound and outbound traffic between the peered VPCs.

VPC peering is a powerful feature in AWS that enables you to build complex network architectures, consolidate resources, and facilitate communication between different VPCs in a secure and efficient manner.

To configure a private connection between an EC2 instance in the us-east-1 region and a DynamoDB table in the us-east-2 region, without using any public IP for communication, you can follow these steps:

Create a VPC Peering Connection: In the AWS Management Console, create a VPC peering connection between the VPC in the us-east-1 region where the EC2 instance is located and the VPC in the us-east-2 region where the DynamoDB table resides. This establishes a private network connection between the two VPCs.

Update Route Tables: Modify the route tables in both VPCs to allow traffic between the subnets associated with the EC2 instance and the DynamoDB table. Add a route in the route table of the us-east-1 VPC pointing to the VPC peering connection for the us-east-2 VPC, and vice versa. This ensures that the traffic destined for the DynamoDB table is routed through the peering connection.

Security Group Configuration: Adjust the security groups associated with the EC2 instance and the DynamoDB table to allow inbound and outbound traffic between them. Update the security group rules to permit the necessary protocols (such as TCP) and ports for communication.

VPC Endpoint for DynamoDB: Create a VPC endpoint for DynamoDB in the us-east-1 VPC. This allows the EC2 instance to directly access the DynamoDB service without needing to go over the public internet. Configure the VPC endpoint to route the traffic to the us-east-2 region where the DynamoDB table is located.

Update Application Configuration: Modify the application running on the EC2 instance to use the appropriate endpoint or endpoint URL for accessing the DynamoDB table. This ensures that the application connects to the DynamoDB service using the private VPC endpoint.

By following these steps, you can establish a private and secure connection between the EC2 instance in the us-east-1 region and the DynamoDB table in the us-east-2 region, without relying on public IPs for communication. The VPC peering connection, route table updates, security group configuration, and VPC endpoint setup enable the private network connectivity required for accessing the DynamoDB table from the EC2 instance.
