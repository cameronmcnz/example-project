You own a MySQL RDS instance in AWS Region us-east-1
The instance has a Multi-AZ instance in another availability zone for high availability.
As business grows, more and more clients come from Europe (eu-west-2), and most of the database workload is read-only.
What is the proper way to reduce the load on the source RDS instance?


[source,java]
----
Network & Security

Destination region
The region in which the replica will be launched

EU (London) Vv

Destination DB subnet group

None Vv

The EC2 Availability Zone that the database instance will be created in.

No preference Vv

Publicly accessible

© Yes

EC2 instances and devices outside of the VPC hosting the DB instance will connect to the DB instances. You must also select one or
more VPC security groups that specify which EC2 instances and devices can connect to the DB instance.

© No

DB instance will not have a public IP address assigned. No EC2 instance or devices outside of the VPC will be able to connect.

* [ ] B. Promote the Multi-AZ instance to be a Read Replica and move the instance to eu-west-2 region.
* [*] C. Configure a read-only Multi-AZ instance in eu-west-2 as Read Replicas cannot span across regions.

Correct Answer - D.
Read Replica should be used to share the read workload of the source DB instance.
Read Replica can also be configured in a different AWS region.
Refer to this link-https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReadRepl.html.
Option A is incorrect: Because Read Replica should be configured to share the read traffic.
You should not launch a totally new instance.
Option B is incorrect: Because a Multi-AZ instance cannot be promoted to be a Read Replica.
Option C is incorrect: Because a Read Replica can be launched in another region for RDS MySQL.
Option D is CORRECT: Users can quickly configure a Read Replica in another region.
The best approach to reduce the load on the source RDS instance while catering to the growing number of clients from the Europe region (eu-west-2) with a read-heavy workload is to create a Read Replica in the eu-west-2 region. The correct answer is option D.
A Read Replica is a feature of Amazon RDS that allows you to create one or more read-only copies of your source DB instance in the same or a different AWS region. These replicas can then be used to offload read traffic from the source DB instance, freeing up resources for other tasks.
Option A (Create a snapshot of the instance and launch a new instance in eu-west-2) is not a recommended solution for reducing the load on the source RDS instance because it involves setting up a new instance from a snapshot, which can take a long time, and any updates made to the source RDS instance will not be reflected in the new instance.
Option B (Promote the Multi-AZ instance to be a Read Replica and move the instance to eu-west-2 region) is also not a recommended solution because it involves promoting the Multi-AZ instance to be a Read Replica and then moving it to the eu-west-2 region. However, Read Replicas cannot be moved across regions, so this option is not feasible.
Option C (Configure a read-only Multi-AZ instance in eu-west-2 as Read Replicas cannot span across regions) is also not a recommended solution because Read Replicas cannot be configured to span across regions. Therefore, this option is not feasible.
In conclusion, creating a Read Replica in the eu-west-2 region is the most appropriate solution for reducing the load on the source RDS instance while catering to the growing number of clients from the Europe region (eu-west-2) with a read-heavy workload.
