[.answer]
D

[.explanation]

Provisioned IOPS SSDs, (IOPS = Input/Output Operations Per Second)  are the best for low-latench and high throughput.

They also come at a higher cost, so make sure the expense justified the benefits.

By the way, there are cold HDDs, but there is no such thing as a hot-swap SSD.
