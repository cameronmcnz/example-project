A company requires to use the AWS RDS service to host a MySQL database.
This database will be used for production purposes and is expected to experience a high number of read/write activities.
Which EBS volume type would be ideal for this database?

Correct Answer - B.
The below snapshot from AWS Documentation shows that the ideal storage option in this scenario is the Provisioned IOPS SSD.
It provides a high number of IOPS for the underlying database.
For more information on EBS volume types, please refer to the URL below.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html
For a production MySQL database that experiences high levels of read/write activities, the ideal EBS volume type would be Provisioned IOPS SSD (B).
Explanation:
EBS volumes are the virtual disks that provide persistent storage for Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon RDS is a managed relational database service that enables easy setup, operation, and scaling of a relational database in the cloud. Amazon RDS supports various database engines such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and Amazon Aurora.
EBS volume types available for use with Amazon RDS include General Purpose SSD, Provisioned IOPS SSD, Throughput Optimized HDD, and Cold HDD.
General Purpose SSD (A) is ideal for small to medium-sized databases with moderate I/O requirements. It offers a balance of price and performance and is designed for a broad range of workloads.
Provisioned IOPS SSD (B) is ideal for mission-critical databases that require consistently high performance and low latency. It provides dedicated IOPS, and the performance can be provisioned and scaled according to the workload.
Throughput Optimized HDD (C) is ideal for large, sequential workloads such as log processing and data warehousing. It provides low-cost throughput performance and is optimized for large, sequential I/O operations.
Cold HDD (D) is ideal for infrequently accessed data and provides the lowest cost per gigabyte of all EBS volumes. However, it has higher latency and lower throughput than other EBS volume types.
In the case of a production MySQL database that experiences high levels of read/write activities, Provisioned IOPS SSD is the best choice because it offers dedicated IOPS and consistent performance, ensuring that the database can handle the workload without any performance degradation.
Therefore, the correct answer is B. Provisioned IOPS SSD.
