Q: How much data can I store in Amazon $3?

The total volume of data and number of objects you can store are unlimited. Individual Amazon $3 objects can range in
size from a minimum of 0 bytes to a maximum of 5 terabytes. The largest object that can be uploaded in a single PUT is
5 gigabytes. For objects larger than 100 megabytes, customers should consider using the Multipart Upload capability.

Answer: D.
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an object storage service that is designed to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web. It is a highly scalable and durable storage system that can store data from a few bytes to petabytes of data.
In terms of file sizes, the minimum and maximum file sizes that can be stored in S3 are:
The minimum file size that can be stored in S3 is 0 bytes. This means that you can store an empty object in S3.
The maximum file size that can be stored in S3 is 5 terabytes (TB). This means that you can store a file that is as large as 5 terabytes in S3.
Therefore, the correct answer to the question is D.
It is important to note that there are certain limitations when uploading large files to S3. For example, if you are using the Amazon S3 console, you can only upload files that are less than 160 GB in size. However, you can use other methods such as the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) or the AWS SDKs to upload larger files to S3.
Additionally, it is important to consider the cost implications of storing large amounts of data in S3. S3 charges for data storage, data transfer, and other related services. Therefore, you should always consider the cost implications before storing large amounts of data in S3.
