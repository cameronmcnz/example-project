Which of the following options is not AWS CloudWatch metric for AWS Lambda function?


[source,java]
----
Metric

Invocations

Errors

Dead Letter Error

Description

Measures the number of times a function is invoked in response to an event or invocation API call.
This replaces the deprecated RequestCount metric. This includes successful and failed invocations, but
does not include throttled attempts. This equals the billed requests for the function. Note that AWS
Lambda only sends these metrics to CloudWatch if they have a nonzero value.

Units: Count

Measures the number of invocations that failed due to errors in the function (response code 4XX). This
replaces the deprecated ErrorCount metric. Failed invocations may trigger a retry attempt that
succeeds. This includes:

* Handled exceptions (for example, context.fail(error))
* Unhandled exceptions causing the code to exit

* Out of memory exceptions

* Timeouts

¢ Permissions errors

This does not include invocations that fail due to invocation rates exceeding default concurrent limits
(error code 429) or failures due to internal service errors (error code 500).

Units: Count

Incremented when Lambda is unable to write the failed event payload to your configured Dead Letter
Queues. This could be due to the following:

¢ Permissions errors

* Throttles from downstream services
* Misconfigured resources

* Timeouts

Units: Count

A.
B.
C.
D.
Answer: A.
The AWS/Lambda namespace includes the following metrics.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/monitoring-functions-metrics.html
All the listed options are AWS CloudWatch metrics for AWS Lambda function except for the Dead Letter Error option, which is not a valid CloudWatch metric for AWS Lambda.
Here's a detailed explanation of each option:
A. Memory: This metric shows the amount of memory that the Lambda function uses during its execution. It is measured in megabytes (MB) and is helpful in optimizing the function's memory allocation.
B. Dead Letter Error: This option is not a valid CloudWatch metric for AWS Lambda. However, a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) is a feature that allows you to capture and store failed events that a Lambda function can't process. When a Lambda function fails to process an event, it can send the event to a DLQ. You can then analyze the failed events to identify and fix the root cause of the issue.
C. Duration: This metric measures the amount of time that a Lambda function takes to execute. It is measured in milliseconds (ms) and is helpful in optimizing the function's performance.
D. Invocations: This metric shows the number of times that a Lambda function is invoked. It is helpful in understanding the function's usage patterns and can help you optimize the function's scaling and resource allocation.
In summary, the correct answer is B, Dead Letter Error, as it is not a valid AWS CloudWatch metric for AWS Lambda function.
