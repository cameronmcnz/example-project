The AWS service that is best suited for migrating an On-Premise Postgres database to the AWS Cloud while keeping it fully operational is AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS).
AWS Database Migration Service is a fully managed service that enables you to migrate databases to AWS easily and securely. It supports a variety of databases, including PostgreSQL, and allows you to perform both homogenous and heterogeneous migrations. With AWS DMS, you can perform a database migration with minimal downtime.
Here are some reasons why AWS DMS is well suited for migrating a database while keeping it fully operational:
1.
Replication: AWS DMS can replicate changes made to the source database to the target database in near real-time. This means that you can keep the source database operational during the migration and minimize downtime.
2.
Continuous Data Replication: AWS DMS continuously replicates changes made to the source database to the target database until the migration is complete. This ensures that the target database is up-to-date and that there is minimal data loss.
3.
Database consistency: AWS DMS ensures that the data is consistent across both the source and target databases. This is important when migrating a database while keeping it operational.
4.
Validation: AWS DMS can validate the data in the target database to ensure that it is accurate and complete.
In summary, AWS Database Migration Service is the most suitable service for migrating an On-Premise Postgres database to AWS Cloud while keeping it fully operational because it provides replication, continuous data replication, database consistency, and validation features.
