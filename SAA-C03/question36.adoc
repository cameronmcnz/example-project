A.
B.
C.
D.
Correct Answer - D.
Option A is incorrect because object-level logging is used to record object-level API activities in CloudTrail.
Users cannot register an SNS topic for object-level logging.
Option B is incorrect because server access logging does not trigger an SNS topic for the object removal events.
Option C is incorrect because you would need to write a custom Lambda function in the AWS Config rule to check the object removal events.
This method is more complicated than option.
D.Option D is CORRECT because with an S3 event notification, you can select which events are enabled for the notification.
The events can be sent to an SNS topic, an SQS queue, or a Lambda function.
Reference:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/enable-event-notifications.html.
The correct answer is D: Configure an S3 event notification for the object removal events. Send the events to an SNS topic.
Explanation:
To receive an email notification whenever an object removal event happens in an S3 bucket, you can use Amazon S3 event notifications. These notifications can be configured to send an email to an Amazon SNS topic when an object is deleted from the S3 bucket.
To configure S3 event notifications for the S3 bucket, follow these steps:
1. Open the Amazon S3 console.
2. Choose the S3 bucket that you want to configure for event notifications.
3. Click on the "Properties" tab.
4. Click on the "Events" section.
5. Click on the "Add notification" button.
6. Choose the event type "Object removal" and provide the prefix or suffix of the object key for which you want to receive notifications.
7. Select the Amazon SNS topic to which you want to send the notification emails.
8. Click on the "Save" button.
Once you have configured the S3 event notification, you will receive an email notification to the SNS topic whenever an object is deleted from the S3 bucket. You can then configure the SNS topic to send an email notification to the appropriate team members.
Option A is incorrect because object-level logging does not provide the ability to send notifications. It only logs the object-level activity in the S3 bucket.
Option B is incorrect because server access logging only logs the requests made to the S3 bucket. It does not provide the ability to send notifications for object removal events.
Option C is incorrect because AWS Config is used to track resource configurations and changes over time. It is not designed to send notifications for object removal events in an S3 bucket.
