Which of the following is not an AWS CloudWatch metric for EBS Volumes?


[source,java]
----
Metric

VolumeReadsytes

VolumewiriteBytes

VolumeReadops

Volumeliriteops

Description

Provides information on the I/O operations in a specified period of time. The Sum
statistic reports the total number of bytes transferred during the period. The
Average statistic reports the average size of each I/O operation during the period,
except on volumes attached to a Nitra instance, where the average represents
the average over the specified period. The SanpleCount statistic reports the total
number of I/O operations during the period, except on volumes attached to a
Nitro instance, where the sample count represents the number of data points
used in the statistical calculation. Data is reported to CloudWatch only when the
volume is active.

The Minimum and Maximum statistics on this metric are supported only by volumes
attached to the following instances: C5, CSd, i3.metal, MS, MSd, RS, R5d, T3, and
21d.

Units: Bytes

The total number of I/O operations in a specified period of time.

To calculate the average I/O operations per second (IOPS) for the period, divide
the total operations in the period by the number of seconds in that period,

‘The Minimum and Maximum statistics on this metric are supported only by volumes
attached to the following instances: C5, C5d, 13.metal, M5, MSd, RS, RSd, T3, and
zd.

Units: Count

D.
Answer: D.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-volume-status.html#using_cloudwatch_ebs
The correct answer is D. VolumeRemainingSize is not an AWS CloudWatch metric for EBS Volumes.
Explanation:
Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides block-level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. AWS CloudWatch is a monitoring service that provides metrics and logs for resources in AWS.
When monitoring Amazon EBS volumes, AWS CloudWatch provides the following metrics:
A. VolumeReadBytes: The total number of bytes that have been read from the volume.
B. VolumeWriteOps: The total number of write operations that have been performed on the volume.
C. VolumeThroughputPercentage: The percentage of I/O operations per second (IOPS) delivered from the total IOPS provisioned for an EBS volume.
D. VolumeRemainingSize: This is not an AWS CloudWatch metric for EBS Volumes. It is not possible to monitor the remaining size of an EBS volume using CloudWatch.
In summary, CloudWatch provides metrics for monitoring the I/O operations and throughput of EBS volumes but does not provide a metric for monitoring the remaining size of an EBS volume.
