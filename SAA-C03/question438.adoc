A large amount of structured data is stored in Amazon S3 using the JSON format.
You need to use a service to analyze the S3 data directly with standard SQL.
In the meantime, the data should be easily visualized through data dashboards.
Which of the following services is the most appropriate?

* [*] A. Amazon Athena and Amazon QuickSight.
* [ ] B. AWS Glue and Amazon Athena.
* [*] C. AWS Glue and Amazon QuickSight.

Click on the arrows to vote for the correct answer
A.
B.
C.
D.
Correct Answer - A.
Option A is CORRECT because Amazon Athena is the most suitable to run ad-hoc queries to analyze data in S3
Amazon Athena is serverless, and you are charged for the amount of scanned data.
Besides, Athena can integrate with Amazon QuickSight that visualizes the data via dashboards.
Option B is incorrect because AWS Glue is an ETL (extract, transform, and load) service that organizes, cleanses, validates, and formats data in a data warehouse.
This service is not required in this scenario.
Option C is incorrect because it is the same as Option.
B.
AWS Glue is not required.
Option D is incorrect because, with Amazon Kinesis Data Stream, users cannot perform queries for the S3 data through standard SQL.

The most appropriate service to analyze the S3 data directly with standard SQL and visualize it through data dashboards is Amazon Athena and Amazon QuickSight. The correct answer is A.
Amazon Athena is a serverless query service that makes it easy to analyze data directly in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. It allows users to easily run ad-hoc queries against structured and unstructured data stored in S3, without the need for infrastructure provisioning or data loading. Athena can handle JSON format data natively, and it supports other common formats like CSV, ORC, and Parquet as well. Therefore, Athena is a great fit for analyzing the structured data stored in S3 using SQL.
Amazon QuickSight is a cloud-native business intelligence service that allows users to easily create interactive visualizations, dashboards, and reports from various data sources including Athena. It supports multiple data formats including CSV, Excel, and JSON. QuickSight provides an easy-to-use interface for data visualization and exploration, which is perfect for creating dashboards to display the analyzed data.
AWS Glue is a fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that helps users to prepare and transform data for analytics. It can be used to create and run ETL jobs that extract data from various sources, transform it, and then load it into a data warehouse or data lake. While AWS Glue can handle JSON format data, it is primarily used for ETL jobs and not for direct data analysis.
Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is a service for real-time data streaming and processing. It allows users to collect and process large amounts of streaming data in real-time. While Kinesis can handle JSON format data, it is primarily used for real-time data processing and not for direct data analysis.
Therefore, the correct answer is A. Amazon Athena and Amazon QuickSight are the most appropriate services for analyzing structured data in S3 with SQL and creating data visualizations through dashboards.
