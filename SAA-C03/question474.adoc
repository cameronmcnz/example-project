D.
Answer: D.
You can associate secondary IPv4 CIDR blocks with your VPC.
When you associate a CIDR block with your VPC, a route is automatically added to your VPC route tables to enable routing within the VPC (the destination is the CIDR block and the target is local).
In the following example, the VPC on the left has a single CIDR block (10.0.0.0/16) and two subnets.
The VPC on the right represents the architecture of the same VPC after you've added a second CIDR block (10.2.0.0/16) and created a new subnet from the range of the second CIDR.

From the above image, the Main route table shows the routes for primary and secondary IP ranges.
So the correct option is.
D.For option A, VPC peering connection route contains Target as pcx-xxxxxx.
For option B, the routing table should contain an entry with 'vgw-xxxxx' for a VPN connection.
For option C, the Direct Connect connection route should contain the Target as vgw-xxxxxx.
