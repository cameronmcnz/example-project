Your organization is building a collaboration platform for which they chose AWS EC2 for web and application servers and MySQL RDS instance as the database.
Due to the nature of the traffic to the application, they would like to increase the number of connections to the RDS instance.
How could this be achieved?

Correct Answer - B.
You manage your DB engine configuration through the use of parameters in a DB parameter group.
DB parameter groups act as a container for engine configuration values that are applied to one or more DB instances.
A default DB parameter group is created if you create a DB instance without specifying a customer-created DB parameter group.
Each default DB parameter group contains database engine defaults and Amazon RDS system defaults based on the engine, compute class, and allocated storage of the instance.
You cannot modify the parameter settings of a default DB parameter group.
You must create your own DB parameter group to change parameter settings from their default value.
Note that not all DB engine parameters can be changed in a customer-created DB parameter group.
If you want to use your own DB parameter group, you simply create a new DB parameter group, modify the desired parameters, and modify your DB instance to use the new DB parameter group.
All DB instances that are associated with a particular DB parameter group get all parameter updates to that DB parameter group.

The correct answer is B. Create a new parameter group, attach it to the DB instance, and change the setting.
Explanation: Amazon RDS is a managed database service provided by AWS that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. By default, the maximum number of allowed connections for an RDS instance depends on the instance class and ranges from a few hundred to several thousand. If the default limit is not enough, you can increase the maximum number of connections by modifying the value of the "max_connections" parameter in a custom parameter group and attaching it to the DB instance.
Option A is incorrect because modifying the database config file directly is not recommended and may cause the database to become unstable or stop working altogether.
Option C is incorrect because option groups are used to enable specific features or functionalities for a DB instance, not to change the maximum number of allowed connections.
Option D is also incorrect because modifying the settings in the default options group is not recommended since it can affect other DB instances using the same group.
To summarize, the best practice to increase the maximum number of connections to an RDS instance is to create a new parameter group, modify the "max_connections" parameter, attach it to the DB instance, and then restart the instance to apply the changes.
