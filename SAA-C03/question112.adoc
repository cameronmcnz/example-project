AWS Aurora is a highly optimized, standards based, managed relational database system service provided by AWS that provides functionality similar to MySQL or PostgreSQL. Benchmarks show Aurora provides four to five times the throughput of MySQL and two to three times the throughput of PostgreSQL.

AWS Aurora is designed to provide better performance and scalability compared to traditional RDS (Relational Database Service) instances running MySQL or PostgreSQL, even when databases are the engine behind the AWS RDS instance. Here are some factors that contribute to the improved performance of Aurora:

Storage Architecture: Aurora uses a distributed and replicated storage architecture that allows it to achieve higher levels of performance and durability. It replicates data across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) and uses SSD-backed storage, resulting in lower latencies and faster I/O operations compared to traditional RDS storage.

Read and Write Scalability: Aurora offers read scaling capabilities, allowing you to create up to 15 replicas of your database, which can handle read traffic. This enables you to distribute read operations across multiple instances, increasing throughput and reducing the load on the primary database. Additionally, Aurora's storage architecture supports high write scalability, allowing it to handle write-intensive workloads efficiently.

Performance Optimization: Aurora's database engine is purpose-built for cloud-scale performance. It includes performance enhancements and optimizations that are specifically designed to leverage the underlying AWS infrastructure. These optimizations include intelligent caching, query acceleration, and parallelized processing, which can significantly improve query performance and overall throughput.

Automatic Scaling: Aurora provides automated scaling capabilities that allow your database to scale both compute and storage resources dynamically based on the workload. This ensures that your application can handle increased traffic and maintain consistent performance without manual intervention.

While the exact performance improvement of Aurora over traditional RDS instances can vary depending on factors such as workload characteristics and configuration, AWS claims that Aurora can deliver up to five times the performance of standard MySQL and PostgreSQL databases. It's important to note that actual performance gains can vary and depend on factors like database size, query complexity, and application design.

It's recommended to conduct performance testing and benchmarking based on your specific workload and requirements to determine the exact performance improvement Aurora can provide for your use case.

On any AWS certification exam question that compares the strengths of Aurora to other products, Aurora will typically come out ahead. AWS wants you to know how great Aurora is. They are very unlikely to suggest scenarios where another vendor's product is better than theirs.
