Q3. What does the TTL of a DNS record determine in relation to query logging in Amazon Route 53?
a. Time taken to respond to the DNS query
b. Number of queries logged for a domain or subdomain
c. Cache duration for a DNS resolver before querying Route 53
d. Number of DNS queries responded to by Route 53

[.answer]
The correct answer is c. Cache duration for a DNS resolver before querying Route 53. The TTL (Time to Live) of a DNS record determines the cache duration for a DNS resolver before querying Route 53 again. If a DNS resolver has already cached the response to a query, it will continue to return the cached response without forwarding the query to Route 53 until the TTL for the corresponding record expires. This impacts the number of queries logged for a domain or subdomain in query logs, as only queries forwarded to Route 53 are logged.
