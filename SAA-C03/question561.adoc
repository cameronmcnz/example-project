In AWS Route 53 record set, which of the following is not a routing policy?


[source,java]
----
Choosing a Routing Policy

When you create a record, you choose a routing pi

icy, which determines how Amazon Route 53 responds to queries:

ple routing policy — Use for a single resource that performs a given function for your domain, for example, a web server that serves content for the example.com website.

* Failover routing policy — Use when you want to configure active-passive failover.

* Geolocation routing policy — Use when you want to route traffic based on the location of your users.

* Geopro:
another.

ity routing policy - Use when you want to route traffic based on the location of your resources and, optionally, shift traffic from resources in one location to resources in

* Latency routing policy — Use when you have resources in multiple AWS Regions and you want to route traffic to the region that provides the best latency.
* Multivalue answer routing policy - Use when you want Route 53 to respond to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records selected at random.
* Weighted routing policy — Use to route traffic to multiple resources in proportions that you specify.

Answer: D.
Options A, B, C are valid routing policies for AWS Route 53.
Following are list of routing policies.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html.
In AWS Route 53, there are four types of routing policies available to choose from to control how the DNS responds to queries from users:
1.
Weighted Routing Policy: Allows distributing traffic across multiple resources in proportion to their assigned weights. You can assign a weight to each record, and Route 53 responds to queries based on the probability of each record being returned.
2.
Geolocation Routing Policy: Allows directing traffic to specific resources based on the geographic location of the user who made the DNS query. You can create a record set for each geographic location, and Route 53 will respond to queries from that location with the appropriate record.
3.
Failover Routing Policy: Allows redirecting traffic from an unhealthy resource to a healthy resource. You can create a primary record for the healthy resource and a secondary record for the backup resource. Route 53 monitors the health of the primary resource, and if it becomes unavailable, Route 53 automatically responds to DNS queries with the secondary record.
4.
Latency-based Routing Policy: Allows directing traffic to the resource that provides the lowest latency for the user. Route 53 measures the latency between the user and each resource and responds to DNS queries with the resource that provides the lowest latency.
There is no such routing policy as "Distributed Routing Policy" in AWS Route 53. Therefore, the correct answer to the given question is option D.
