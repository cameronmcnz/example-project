Amazon QuickSight is a business analytics service you can use to build visualizations, charts, perform ad hoc analysis, and get business insights from your data.
It can automatically discover AWS data sources and also works with your data sources.
Option A is incorrect as AWS Athena doesn't provide visualizations.
Option C is incorrect as using a third-party tool to analyze cost &amp; usage reports can be costly.
Option D is incorrect as Amazon Redshift is a petabyte-scale data warehouse service in the cloud.

The media company is facing a challenge in managing the costs associated with their AWS resources used for broadcasting live sports matches. They need a customized analysis of their charges based on various factors like month-wise, instance-wise to deep dive into the incurred cost, and visualize the cost analysis on a chart display. The solution should be cost-effective and set up with the least effort.
Option A: Upload the AWS Cost and Usage Reports to S3. Integrate these reports with Amazon Athena to analyze billing data.
This solution involves uploading the AWS Cost and Usage Reports to Amazon S3 and integrating these reports with Amazon Athena to analyze the billing data. Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. The Cost and Usage Reports are automatically generated by AWS and provide comprehensive cost and usage data for AWS services. This option allows the company to analyze their billing data using SQL queries and visualize the results using a chart display.
Option B: Upload AWS Cost & Usage Reports to Amazon QuickSight & analyze billing data.
This solution involves uploading the AWS Cost and Usage Reports to Amazon QuickSight and analyzing the billing data. Amazon QuickSight is a cloud-based business intelligence service that enables users to create and publish interactive dashboards, reports, and charts. The Cost and Usage Reports can be used to create customized dashboards and reports to visualize the billing data.
Option C: Download CSV report from Amazon S3 & analyze cost & usage using a third-party tool.
This solution involves downloading the CSV report from Amazon S3 and analyzing the cost and usage data using a third-party tool. This option requires the use of a third-party tool that can analyze the CSV report, which may not be cost-effective.
Option D: Upload AWS Cost & Usage Reports to Amazon Redshift & analyze billing data.
This solution involves uploading the AWS Cost and Usage Reports to Amazon Redshift and analyzing the billing data. Amazon Redshift is a fast, fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service that makes it simple and cost-effective to analyze all your data using standard SQL and existing Business Intelligence (BI) tools. This option requires setting up and managing a Redshift cluster, which may not be cost-effective.
Out of these options, the best solution would be Option A: Upload the AWS Cost and Usage Reports to S3. Integrate these reports with Amazon Athena to analyze billing data. This option is cost-effective, requires the least effort, and allows the company to analyze their billing data using standard SQL queries and visualize the results using a chart display.
