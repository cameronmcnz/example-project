Correct Answer - C.
While considering storage volume types for batch processing activities with large throughput, consider using the EBS Throughput Optimized volume type.
AWS Documentation mentions this, as shown below.
For more information on EBS Volume Types, please visit the following URL-
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html
Based on the requirements mentioned in the question, the application requires an EC2 instance to perform log processing activities continuously, with a maximum data throughput of 500MiB/s. To determine the most cost-effective storage option for this requirement, we need to consider the various EBS volume types that are available in AWS.
Here is a brief overview of the EBS volume types:
1.
General Purpose SSD (gp2): This type of EBS volume is designed for general-purpose workloads and offers a balance of price and performance. It is suitable for most workloads, including boot volumes, low-latency interactive apps, and dev/test environments.
2.
Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1): This type of EBS volume is designed for I/O-intensive workloads, such as large databases and applications that require high IOPS, high throughput, and low latency. It provides predictable and consistent performance and can be scaled up to 64,000 IOPS per volume.
3.
Throughput Optimized HDD (st1): This type of EBS volume is designed for frequently accessed, throughput-intensive workloads, such as big data, data warehouses, and log processing. It provides low-cost storage with high throughput performance, suitable for large sequential reads and writes.
4.
Cold HDD (sc1): This type of EBS volume is designed for infrequently accessed workloads, such as backups and long-term archives. It provides low-cost storage with low throughput performance, suitable for large sequential reads and writes.
Based on the requirement mentioned in the question, the application requires an EC2 instance to continuously perform log processing activities, requiring a maximum data throughput of 500MiB/s. Therefore, the most cost-effective storage option for this requirement is EBS Throughput Optimized (st1).
EBS Throughput Optimized (st1) volumes provide low-cost storage optimized for throughput-intensive workloads. These volumes are designed to deliver high throughput performance that scales up to 500MB/s per volume, making them ideal for log processing activities.
EBS IOPS (io1) volumes are designed for I/O-intensive workloads that require high IOPS, high throughput, and low latency, and are therefore not the best option for this requirement. EBS SSD (gp2) volumes are designed for general-purpose workloads and may not provide the required throughput performance. EBS Cold Storage (sc1) volumes provide low-cost storage with low throughput performance, making them unsuitable for log processing activities.
Therefore, based on the requirements mentioned in the question, EBS Throughput Optimized (st1) is the most cost-effective storage option for this application.
