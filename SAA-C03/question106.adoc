You have images and static web content hosted in Amazon S3 buckets. However, your clients are distributed around the globe so you will use CloudFront to handle distribution at scale.

All your resources have S3 URLs, but CloudFront won't work if the S3 URLs are accessed directly. How do you ensure clients go through CloudFront first to access your S3 content?

* [ ] A. Use signed URLs for all content accessed through CloudFront.
* [ ] B. Engle Signed Cookies in CloudFront while also disabling direct S3 access
* [ ] C. Use a origin access identity (OAI) with the CloudFront distribution.
* [ ] D. Use HTTPS for S3 access. All secure requests will automatically go through Cloud Front

If you want to make sure S3 URLs are not accessed directly, set up Origin Access Identiy (OAI) in your configuration.

The Origin Access Identity (OAI) is a feature provided by Amazon CloudFront to enhance security and control access to the content stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. The purpose of using an OAI is to ensure that S3 URLs are not hit directly and are instead handled by CloudFront.

When CloudFront is configured with an S3 bucket as the origin, the default behavior allows direct access to the S3 URLs, bypassing the CloudFront distribution. This means that users can potentially access the content directly from the S3 bucket, bypassing any security or caching features provided by CloudFront.

By using an OAI, you can restrict access to the S3 bucket only through CloudFront. Here's how it works:

Create an Origin Access Identity: In the CloudFront console, you create an Origin Access Identity, which is a special CloudFront user associated with your distribution.

Grant Permissions to the OAI: Next, you modify the permissions of your S3 bucket to grant read access to the Origin Access Identity. This step ensures that only CloudFront, acting on behalf of the OAI, can access the objects in the bucket.

Update CloudFront Distribution Settings: In the CloudFront distribution settings, you associate the OAI with the S3 origin. This step tells CloudFront to use the OAI when fetching content from the S3 bucket.

CloudFront URL for Accessing Content: Once the OAI is configured, you access the content through the CloudFront URL (e.g., d12345.cloudfront.net). This ensures that all requests for the content are routed through CloudFront, which then retrieves the content from the S3 bucket using the associated OAI.

Using an Origin Access Identity prevents direct access to S3 URLs and enforces that all requests are made through CloudFront. This provides several benefits, such as enhanced security, centralized control, the ability to apply caching and distribution settings, and improved performance through CloudFront's global edge network.
