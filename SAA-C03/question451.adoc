A.
B.
C.
D.
Correct Answer - D.
Options A, B and C are incorrect: Because EC2 Instance Savings Plans apply to usage regardless of size, OS, or tenancy within the specified family.
In this Savings Plan, the C5 instance family is selected.
All instances using the C5 instance type can get a discount.
Option D is CORRECT: Because the instances in Options A, B and C use the C5 instance type.
So all of them are covered by the new Savings Plan.
An example of creating a Savings Plan for the c5 instance family is as follows:
Reference:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/latest/userguide/what-is-savings-plans.html
EC2 Instance Savings Plans (ISPs) are a flexible pricing model for EC2 instances that offer significant savings in exchange for a commitment to a specific instance family, region, and term length. ISPs can provide up to 72% discount compared to On-Demand pricing.
In this scenario, you have created a new EC2 Instance Savings Plan in the Asia Pacific region (Sydney), and committed to $20/hour of usage for one year, and the instance family is selected as C5.
The C5 instance family is optimized for compute-intensive workloads and offers high performance and network throughput. Therefore, to receive a discount, the EC2 instances must belong to the C5 instance family.
Now, let's examine each option to determine if they meet the criteria for receiving a discount:
A. An Amazon Linux instance (c5.xlarge): This instance belongs to the C5 instance family and is eligible for the discount.
B. A Windows instance (c5.2xlarge): This instance also belongs to the C5 instance family and is eligible for the discount.
C. A Red Hat Linux instance with Dedicated Tenancy (c5.2xlarge): This instance also belongs to the C5 instance family and is eligible for the discount. The dedicated tenancy does not affect the eligibility for the discount.
D. All of the above: This option is correct since all three instances belong to the C5 instance family and meet the criteria for receiving a discount.
Therefore, the correct answer is D. All of the above.
