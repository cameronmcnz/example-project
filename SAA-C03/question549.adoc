Answer: B.
Following are the default metric types available for Simple Policy and Step Policy.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-scaling-simple-step.html
Auto Scaling is a service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that helps to ensure that the number of EC2 instances running matches the current demand for the application.
When configuring Auto Scaling, you can define one or more policies that determine when to add or remove instances based on certain conditions or metrics. Metrics are used to monitor the health of your application and make decisions about scaling actions.
There are several metric types available for use with Auto Scaling Group policies, including:
Average CPU Utilization
Average Network In
Average Network Out
Average Disk Read Ops
Average Disk Write Ops
Sum Request Count
Sum HTTP 4xx Error Count
Sum HTTP 5xx Error Count
The answer to the question is B. Memory Utilization, as it is not a default metric type for Auto Scaling Group policy.
However, you can use custom CloudWatch metrics for your Auto Scaling Group policies, which allows you to track any metric that is available through CloudWatch, including memory utilization.
To summarize, the default metric types for Auto Scaling Group policy are average CPU utilization, average network in, average network out, average disk read ops, sum request count, sum HTTP 4xx error count, and sum HTTP 5xx error count. However, you can use custom CloudWatch metrics to track other metrics, such as memory utilization.
