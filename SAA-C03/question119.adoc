You need to architect a data persistence system that will save metadata about the upscaling process as low resolution films are pulled from one S3 bucket, processed in increments, and then uploaded to a second S3 bucket after processing.

Which system would be best to use to handle the metadata generated from this process, especially given the fact that the metadata may not always follow the same data structure.

Snowball is a device used for moving on-prem data to an AWS storage, so that's incorrect.

AWS Aurora is never a bad choice for persistence, but it is best for structured data.

AWS RedShift is a data warehousing solution that likes structured data and is often used for massive, peta-byte data systems. It's not a good fit here.

AWS DyanmoDB is a simple, cheap, nosql database that is great at handling unstrucutred data. It's a great fit here.


Many test takers get tripped up on the difference between DynamoDB and Redshift, but they are very different. DynamoDB and Redshift are indeed database services, but they are designed for very different use cases:

Amazon DynamoDB: DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service provided by AWS. It is designed for fast and predictable performance at any scale. DynamoDB offers seamless scalability, automatic data replication across multiple availability zones, and built-in security features. It is a suitable choice for applications that require low-latency access to data and have unpredictable or rapidly changing workloads. DynamoDB is often used for use cases such as real-time applications, gaming, mobile, and ad tech, where fast read and write performance with high scalability is crucial. It provides flexible data models and automatic indexing to handle a wide variety of data types.

Amazon Redshift: Redshift is a fully managed data warehousing solution provided by AWS. It is designed for analyzing large datasets and running complex queries across them. Redshift uses columnar storage and parallel query execution to deliver high-performance analytics with low latency. It provides scalability for data storage and processing, enabling you to scale your data warehouse based on your needs. Redshift is optimized for online analytical processing (OLAP) workloads and is commonly used for business intelligence, reporting, and data analysis. It supports SQL queries and integrates with various business intelligence tools and data visualization platforms.

These are the key differences between DynamoDB and Redshift:

Data Model: DynamoDB is a NoSQL database with a flexible schema, suitable for unstructured and semi-structured data. Redshift, on the other hand, is a columnar data warehouse built for structured data and optimized for OLAP queries.

Workload: DynamoDB is well-suited for transactional and real-time workloads that require fast, low-latency access to data. Redshift is designed for analytics workloads, where complex queries and aggregations are performed on large datasets.

Scalability: Both DynamoDB and Redshift offer scalability, but DynamoDB excels in horizontal scalability and can handle millions of requests per second. Redshift provides vertical scalability by scaling compute and storage independently to handle large volumes of data.

Pricing: DynamoDB pricing is based on provisioned throughput capacity and storage, while Redshift pricing is based on the amount of storage and the compute resources utilized.

Ultimately, the choice between DynamoDB and Redshift depends on your specific requirements and the nature of your workload. If you need a highly scalable, low-latency database for transactional or real-time applications, DynamoDB is a good fit. If you have large datasets and require powerful analytics capabilities with complex querying, Redshift is the preferred choice.
