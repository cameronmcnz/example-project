A Redshift cluster currently contains 60TB of data.
There is a requirement that a disaster recovery site is put in place in another region.
Which solution would help ensure that this requirement is fulfilled?

Configure Cross-Region Snapshots

You can configure cross-regional snapshots when you want Amazon Redshift to
‘automatically copy snapshots (automated or manual) to another region for backup
purposes. Note that copying snapshots from the source region to a destination region
incurs data transfer charges.

Correct Answer - B.
The below diagram shows that snapshots are available for Redshift clusters enabling them to be available in different regions.
For more information on managing Redshift snapshots, please visit the following URLs:

The correct answer for this question is B. Enable Cross-Region snapshots for the Redshift Cluster.
Explanation: The question requires a disaster recovery solution for a Redshift cluster that contains 60TB of data. The solution should also be located in another region to ensure data redundancy in the event of a disaster. In this scenario, cross-region snapshots are the most suitable solution because they offer several benefits, including:
1.
Automatic replication: Cross-region snapshots automatically replicate data to a secondary region, providing a reliable disaster recovery solution.
2.
Easy restore: In the event of a disaster, restoring the cluster in the secondary region is as simple as restoring from a snapshot.
3.
Reduced downtime: Since the data is already replicated in another region, restoring the cluster is quicker, reducing downtime.
Option A, taking a copy of the underlying EBS volumes to S3 and then doing Cross-Region Replication is not a recommended approach for Redshift disaster recovery because EBS volumes are not the primary storage mechanism for Redshift. Redshift uses a distributed storage system, where data is spread across multiple nodes, and copying the underlying EBS volumes to S3 may not capture all of the data.
Option C, creating a CloudFormation template to restore the cluster in another region, is not a recommended approach for Redshift disaster recovery because it is time-consuming and does not offer automatic replication.
Option D, enabling Cross Availability Zone snapshots for the Redshift Cluster, only offers protection against single AZ failures, and not across regions, which is the requirement in this scenario.
Therefore, option B, enabling Cross-Region snapshots for the Redshift Cluster, is the most suitable solution for this scenario.
