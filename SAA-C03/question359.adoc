A.
B.
C.
D.
Answer - D.
The instance type determines the hardware of the host computer used for your instance.
Each instance type offers different compute, memory, and storage capabilities, and is grouped in an instance family based on these capabilities.

When designing the application architecture for a company, it is important to consider various factors to ensure optimal performance, reliability, and scalability of the system. In this scenario, the architecture will consist of a web tier that will be hosted on EC2 Instances placed behind an Elastic Load Balancer. One important decision that needs to be made is selecting the appropriate EC2 instance type.
There are various factors that can help in deciding the instance type of the EC2 instances, and the options provided in the question are:
A. Determine the required I/O performance. B. Determine the minimum memory requirements. C. Determine the storage capabilities required for the application. D. All the above options.
Let's discuss each option in more detail:
A. Determine the required I/O performance: Input/output (I/O) performance is an important consideration when selecting an EC2 instance type, especially for applications that require high I/O operations, such as databases, analytics, and machine learning. In such cases, it is recommended to select an instance type that provides high I/O performance, such as instances that use NVMe SSD or local instance storage. Therefore, determining the required I/O performance is a key factor in deciding the EC2 instance type.
B. Determine the minimum memory requirements: Memory is another important consideration when selecting an EC2 instance type. Applications that require a large amount of memory, such as in-memory databases or caching systems, should use instance types with a high memory capacity. In addition, some applications may require a certain minimum amount of memory to function properly. Therefore, determining the minimum memory requirements is another important factor in deciding the EC2 instance type.
C. Determine the storage capabilities required for the application: Storage requirements can also impact the selection of the EC2 instance type. Applications that require high storage capacity should use instance types with larger storage volumes or that support network-attached storage (NAS). In addition, some applications may require specific storage types, such as solid-state drives (SSDs) or magnetic disks. Therefore, determining the storage capabilities required for the application is another important factor in deciding the EC2 instance type.
D. All the above options: As all the options mentioned above are important factors in deciding the EC2 instance type, selecting "All the above options" is also a valid answer.
In conclusion, when designing the application architecture for a company, it is important to consider various factors when selecting the appropriate EC2 instance type. The factors mentioned in the options provided in the question - I/O performance, memory requirements, and storage capabilities - are all important considerations that can help in making the decision.
