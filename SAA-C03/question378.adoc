A company has an application that needs to be hosted on an EC2 Instance.
The general amount of throughput data per volume will be in the range of 400-500 MiB/s from the application.
Which of the following should be used as the storage type for the underlying EC2 Instance in a Cost-effective manner?

Answer - C.
When you want high throughput, you should choose using the Throughput Optimized EBS volume.
The below snapshot from the AWS Documentation shows the features of the different types of volumes.
As per the above document,
Option A, B and D stands invalid.
For more information on the EBS volume types, please refer to the below URL-
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html
For an application that requires high throughput, it's important to choose a storage option that can handle the amount of data required by the application.
Out of the given options, the most cost-effective storage type for this particular use case would be the "EBS - Throughput Optimized HDD" (option C).
The Throughput Optimized HDD volume type is designed to provide low-cost, high-performance storage for frequently accessed, throughput-intensive workloads such as big data, data warehousing, and log processing. It provides up to 500 MiB/s of throughput per volume, which falls within the range required by the application.
Option A (EBS - General Purpose SSD) and option B (EBS - Provisioned IOPS SSD) are solid-state drive (SSD) storage types, which are generally more expensive than HDD storage types. While they offer faster I/O performance, they might not be as cost-effective for workloads with high throughput requirements.
Option D (EBS - Cold HDD) is a lower-cost HDD storage type that is intended for infrequently accessed data. It does not offer the required level of throughput required by the application.
In summary, for a cost-effective option for an EC2 instance hosting an application with high throughput requirements, EBS - Throughput Optimized HDD (option C) is the best option among the given choices.
